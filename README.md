# TRON
The computer game called TRON filled the arcades in the 1980s, and its legacy lived on in numerous later editions.
The aim of the game is to capture the most possible tiles exactly one time without crossing the opponent's path or
the tiles that was occupied before. The strategies used in TRON could be very versatile and complex because you have
to keep track of both player's position.

The focus of this project is to create an artificial intelligence based control algorithm which can be applied to TRON. The
algorithm uses deep learning based neural networks, today's most hyped machine learning method.

The ideas behing the construction of the neural networks will be focused in the project. It shows each individual steps towards
the final structure. As the network can learn from its previous experiments, we can call different generations of the ultimate
algorithm. Due to the better understanding of the learning process the different generations have been implemented individually.

The project also contains a TRON simulator, in which the user can be tested against AI algorithms. Due to the graphical
environment the matches of the different AI based strategies can be observed.
