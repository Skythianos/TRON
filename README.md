# TRON
The computer game called TRON filled the arcades in the 1980s, and its legacy lived on in numerous later editions.
The aim of the game is to capture the most possible tiles exactly one time without crossing the opponent's path or
the tiles that was occupied before. The strategies used in TRON could be very versatile and complex because you have
to keep track of both player's position.
